## Description

The program analyzes spread out of values in a data set around the mean (average) of that set. Low standard deviation suggests data points are consistently close to the mean, indicating reliability and predictability. High standard deviation suggests variability, indicating that the data points are spread out and less predictable.

Here blood pressure study of systolic readings of two individuals indicate that one is stable and other is heavily fluctuating causing greater risk of heart attack.

## Technologies-used

Python programming language, pandas and matplotlib package.

## Dataset

The data file used in this program is a csv file which has been generated by another program. However, it is recommended that for real life analysis actual data should be collected and processed properly to get realistic results.

## Program-codes

The programs are written on jupiter notebook, You may run the program on Google colab by clicking on the colab badge below.
